# studentRoster

Overview: Using a given class roster consisting of 5 students, show the following information to the user:
All students and their information, a list of invalid email addresses, the average amount of days that each student can complete 3 courses, students in the software degree program, removal of a student from the roster, an updated list of all students, and a search output for the removed student.

Technical: This program prints to the console and does not require user interaction. This project demonstrated my knowledge of the basics object oriented programming, writing functions, parsing array string data, creating enum variables, looping through an array, and printing to the console.
